# AndroidBasicApps
This repo contains several apps that introduce Android basic features

Repo is organised into two main directories
1. AppSource -- contains only complete source code of the application. Apps under this directory can be imported into Android Studio.
2. LookupFiles -- contains only the important java/xml/screenshots files that define the core of the application. Users can quickly look into the source.
